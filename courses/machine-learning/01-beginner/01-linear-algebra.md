# Lesson 1: Linear Algebra

## Learning Goals

- Vectors & Matrices.
- Dot Product.

## 1. Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Tensors

- **Scalar**: A single number ($x = 5$).
- **Vector**: A 1D array of numbers ($v = [1, 2, 3]$).
- **Matrix**: A 2D grid of numbers ($M = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]$).
- **Tensor**: A n-D grid. Images are 3D tensors (Height, Width, Color).

## 2. Operations

- **Addition**: Element-wise.
- **Dot Product**: The sum of element-wise products.
  - Essential for Neural Networks (Input \* Weight).
  - $A \cdot B = \sum A_i B_i$.

## Key Takeaways

- Modern ML is just massive matrix multiplication on GPUs.
- Understanding shape (dimensions) is 50% of debugging.
