# Lesson 3: Probability & Statistics

## Learning Goals

- Distributions.
- Bias & Variance.

## 1. Probability Distributions

- **Normal (Gaussian)**: The "Bell Curve". Most natural phenomena (height, errors) follow this.
- **Bernoulli**: Coin flip (0 or 1).

## 2. Descriptive Statistics

- **Mean**: Average.
- **Median**: Middle value (robust to outliers).
- **Variance/Standard Deviation**: How "spread out" the data is.

## 3. Bayes Theorem

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
Updates our belief ($P(A)$) based on new evidence ($B$).

## Key Takeaways

- ML models deal with uncertainty.
- Understanding the distribution of your data is critical for choosing the right model.
