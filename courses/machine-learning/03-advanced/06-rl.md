# Lesson 6: Reinforcement Learning

## Learning Goals

- Agent, Environment, Reward.
- Q-Learning.

## 1. The Loop

An **Agent** takes an **Action** in an **Environment**.
The Environment returns a **State** and a **Reward**.
Goal: Maximize cumulative reward.

## 2. Exploration vs Exploitation

- **Explore**: Try random actions to discover new strategies.
- **Exploit**: Do what you know yields the highest reward.

## 3. Deep Q-Learning

Using a Neural Network to approximate the "Q-Function" (Quality of an action).
Used by DeepMind to play Atari.

## Key Takeaways

- RL is unstable and sample-inefficient compared to Supervised Learning.
- Used in Robotics, Game AI, and Resource Management.
