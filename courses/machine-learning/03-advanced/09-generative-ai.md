# Lesson 9: Generative AI

## Learning Goals

- GANs.
- Diffusion Models.

## 1. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

Two networks fighting.

- **Generator**: Tries to create fake images.
- **Discriminator**: Tries to spot the fakes.
  They improve each other.

## 2. Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion)

Add noise to an image until it's static.
Train a network to _reverse_ the process (remove noise).
Generate image by starting with random noise and denoising it guided by a text prompt.

## Key Takeaways

- GenAI is creating new data, not just classifying existing data.
- Ethics and Deepfakes are major concerns.
