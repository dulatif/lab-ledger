# 1. What are Relational Databases? (RDBMS vs NoSQL)

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Understand the table-based world.

## 🧠 Concept

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**:
Data is stored in **Tables** (Rows & Columns). Tables are related via Keys.
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.

- **Structured**: Schema must be defined upfront.
- **ACID**: Guarantees reliability.

**NoSQL**:
Document, Key-Value, or Graph. Flexible schema.
Examples: MongoDB, Redis.

## 💻 Implementation

| ID  | Name  | Role  |
| :-- | :---- | :---- |
| 1   | Alice | Admin |
| 2   | Bob   | User  |

## 🧩 Activity / Challenge

1.  Imagine an Excel sheet. That's a Table.
2.  Imagine linking "Role" to another sheet called "Roles". That's a Relation.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- SQL is about Structure and Relationships.
