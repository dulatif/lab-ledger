Based on the `sql.pdf` roadmap you uploaded, here is a structured syllabus for mastering SQL, organized by proficiency level.

### **Level 1: Beginner (Foundations & Data Management)**

**Goal:** Understand relational database concepts, master basic syntax, and perform essential CRUD operations.

**Module 1: Relational Concepts**

- **Theory:** Understanding "What are Relational Databases?" and "RDBMS Benefits and Limitations".

- **Comparison:** Comparing SQL vs NoSQL Databases.

- **Core Syntax:** Learning Basic SQL Syntax, including SQL Keywords, Data Types, and Operators.

**Module 2: Defining Structure (DDL)**

- **Table Management:** Mastering Data Definition Language (DDL) commands: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, and `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

- **Constraints:** Implementing Data Constraints to ensure quality: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, NOT NULL, and CHECK.

**Module 3: Manipulating Data (DML)**

- **Basic Operations:** Using Data Manipulation Language (DML) for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- **Querying:** Mastering the `SELECT` statement, including `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `DISTINCT` (implied by syntax).

### **Level 2: Intermediate (Analysis & Complexity)**

**Goal:** Write complex queries using joins, aggregations, and built-in functions to analyze data.

**Module 4: Aggregation & Grouping**

- **Functions:** Using Aggregate Queries like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

- **Grouping:** Organizing results with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups with `HAVING`.

**Module 5: Joining Tables**

- **Join Types:** Mastering JOIN Queries including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

- **Special Joins:** Utilizing `Self Join` and `Cross Join`.

**Module 6: Advanced Functions**

- **String Manipulation:** Using String Functions like `CONCAT`, `LENGTH`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`, `UPPER`, and `LOWER`.

- **Math:** Applying Numeric Functions like `FLOOR`, `ABS`, `MOD`, `ROUND`, and `CEILING`.

- **Date/Time:** Working with Date and Time functions: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATEPART`, and `DATEADD`.

- **Logic:** Implementing Conditional logic with `CASE`, `NULLIF`, and `COALESCE`.

**Module 7: Subqueries & Views**

- **Subqueries:** Writing Nested Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries.

- **Views:** Managing Views: Creating Views, Modifying Views, and Dropping Views.

---

### **Level 3: Advanced (Performance & Administration)**

**Goal:** Optimize query performance, manage transactions, and implement security protocols.

**Module 8: Performance Optimization**

- **Indexing:** Managing Indexes to speed up retrieval.

- **Analysis:** Using Query Analysis Techniques to identify bottlenecks.

- **Optimization Strategies:** Query Optimization Techniques including Using Indexes, Optimizing Joins, Reducing Subqueries, and Selective Projection.

**Module 9: Transactions & Security**

- **ACID:** Understanding Transactions and the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

- **Control:** Using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

- **Isolation:** Configuring Transaction Isolation Levels.

- **Security:** Implementing Data Integrity & Security, DB Security Best Practices, and managing permissions with `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

**Module 10: Advanced Features**

- **Window Functions:** Analytical functions like `rank`, `dense_rank`, `lead`, `lag`, and `row_number`.

- **Recursion:** Writing Recursive Queries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

- **Procedural SQL:** Creating Stored Procedures & Functions and Dynamic SQL.

- **Transformation:** Handling Pivot / Unpivot Operations.
