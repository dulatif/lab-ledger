# 1. Web Standards and API Basics

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Understand what an API is and the ecosystem it lives in.

## 🧠 Concept

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules that allows two software programs to communicate.
**The Web**: Built on standards like HTTP, URI, and MIME types.

## 💻 Implementation

An API is just a waiter in a restaurant.

1.  **You (Client)**: Look at menu (Documentation).
2.  **Order (Request)**: Tell waiter what you want.
3.  **Kitchen (Server)**: Prepares the food.
4.  **Waiter (API)**: Brings it back (Response).

## 🧩 Activity / Challenge

1.  Identify 3 APIs you use daily (e.g., Weather app uses a Weather API).
2.  Imagine if every app had to build its own global weather station network. APIs allow reuse.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- APIs are the glue of the modern web.
