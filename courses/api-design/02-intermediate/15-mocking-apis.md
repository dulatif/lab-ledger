# 15. Mocking APIs for Parallel Development

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Unblock the Frontend team.

## 🧠 Concept

Frontend needs to work _before_ Backend is finished.
**Mock Server**: Returns fake data based on the OpenAPI Spec.

## 💻 Implementation

Tools like Prism or Postman Mock Server.

1.  Write OpenAPI Spec.
2.  Run Prism.
3.  Frontend hits `localhost:4010`.

## 🧩 Activity / Challenge

1.  Agree on the Contract (YAML) first.
2.  Both teams sprint in parallel.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Contract-First development speeds up teams.
