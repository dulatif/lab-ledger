# 12. API Lifecycle Management & Governance

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Managing APIs as Products.

## 🧠 Concept

1.  **Design**: Specs, Review.
2.  **Develop**: Mocking, Coding.
3.  **Secure**: Scanning.
4.  **Publish**: Developer Portal, SDKs.
5.  **Monitor**: Analytics.
6.  **Deprecate**: Sunset policy.

## 💻 Implementation

**Governance**: Rules (e.g., "All APIs must have snake_case fields"). Linting specs automatically (Spectral).

## 🧩 Activity / Challenge

1.  Without governance, you end up with `userId`, `user_id`, and `User_ID` across different services.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Consistency is the #1 Driver of Developer Experience (DX).
