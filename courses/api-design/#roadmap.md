Based on the `api-design.pdf` roadmap you uploaded, here is a structured syllabus divided into three proficiency levels. This curriculum covers the entire lifecycle of API development, from basic HTTP protocols to advanced architectural patterns.

### **Level 1: Beginner (Foundations of the Web & HTTP)**

**Goal:** Understand the underlying protocols of the web and the basic structure of API requests and responses.

**Module 1: Network Fundamentals**

- **Core Concepts:** Definition of APIs and "Learning the Basics".

- **Infrastructure:** Understanding TCP/IP and the Basics of DNS.

- **Request Anatomy:** Working with URL, Query, and Path Parameters.

**Module 2: The HTTP Protocol**

- **Protocol Basics:** Overview of HTTP and HTTP Versions.

- **Communication:** Mastering HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

- **Server Responses:** Interpreting HTTP Status Codes.

- **Metadata:** Using HTTP Headers and Content Negotiation.

- **State Management:** HTTP Cookies and Caching strategies.

- **Browser Security:** Understanding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

**Module 3: Introduction to API Styles**

- **Overview:** Survey of Different API Styles.

- **REST Basics:** Introduction to RESTful APIs and Simple JSON APIs.

- **Legacy & Modern:** Brief introduction to SOAP APIs.

### **Level 2: Intermediate (Design, Security & Testing)**

**Goal:** Design robust RESTful systems, implement security standards, and master testing workflows.

**Module 4: RESTful API Design**

- **Core Standards:** Deep dive into REST Principles.

- **Resource Modeling:** URI Design and Handling CRUD Operations.

- **Data Control:** Implementation of Pagination and Versioning Strategies.

- **Reliability:** Understanding Idempotency and Error Handling.

- **Standards:** Implementing RFC 7807 (Problem Details for APIs) and HATEOAS.

**Module 5: Security & Authentication**

- **Auth Foundations:** API Authentication and Authorization.

- **Basic Methods:** Basic Auth , Session Based Auth , and API Keys Management.

- **Modern Auth:** Token Based Auth , JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , and OAuth 2.0.

- **Access Control:** Authorization Methods including RBAC (Role-Based) and ABAC (Attribute-Based).

- **Hardening:** API Security Best Practices and mitigating Common Vulnerabilities.

**Module 6: Documentation & Testing**

- **Documentation:** Using API Documentation Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI , Readme.com , and Stoplight.

- **Development Tools:** Mastering Postman for testing and development.

- **Testing Strategy:** API Testing fundamentals including Unit Testing , Integration Testing , Functional Testing , and Mocking APIs.

### **Level 3: Advanced (Architecture, Performance & Scale)**

**Goal:** Build scalable distributed systems, optimize performance, and ensure legal compliance.

**Module 7: Advanced API Architectures**

- **Modern Protocols:** GraphQL APIs and gRPC APIs.

- **Integration Patterns:** Synchronous vs Asynchronous APIs and Webhooks vs Polling.

- **Distributed Systems:** Microservices Architecture and API Gateways.

- **Event-Driven:** Event Driven Architecture , Messaging Queues (RabbitMQ , Kafka ).

- **Data Processing:** Batch Processing.

**Module 8: Performance Engineering**

- **Optimization:** API Performance Best Practices and Caching Strategies.

- **Traffic Management:** Rate Limiting / Throttling and Load Balancing.

- **Reliability:** Error Handling / Retries and Circuit Breaking.

- **Analysis:** Profiling, Monitoring, and Performance Metrics.

- **Load Testing:** Conducting Load Testing to ensure scalability.

**Module 9: Real-Time & Compliance**

- **Real-Time Data:** Real-time APIs using Web Sockets and Server Sent Events (SSE).

- **Testing Contracts:** Contract Testing for microservices.

- **Governance:** API Lifecycle Management.

- **Compliance:** Standards and Compliance covering GDPR , CCPA , PCI DSS , HIPAA , and handling PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
