# Lesson 8: End-to-End (E2E)

## Learning Goals

- Cypress vs Playwright.
- Testing Flows.

## 1. The Philosophy

Unit tests mock everything. E2E tests mock nothing (or very little).
They run in a real browser, click real buttons, and hit the real render engine.

## 2. Cypress Example

```javascript
describe("My First Test", () => {
  it("Visits the Kitchen Sink", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:5173");
    cy.contains("Welcome to Vue");
    cy.get(".btn").click();
  });
});
```

## 3. Playwright

Similar, but runs parallel and headless by default. Faster, but slightly steeper learning curve.

## Key Takeaways

- E2E tests give the highest confidence but are slow and flaky.
- Pyramid of Testing: Many Unit Tests, Some Integration Tests, Few E2E Tests.
