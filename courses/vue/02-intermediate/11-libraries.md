# Lesson 11: External Libraries

## Learning Goals

- Tailwind CSS.
- Vue UI Libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify).

## 1. Tailwind CSS

Utility-first CSS framework. Unofficial standard for modern Vue apps.
Installation via PostCSS.

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
```

## 2. UI Component Libraries

If you don't want to build Inputs, Tables, and Modals from scratch.

- **PrimeVue**: High quality, unstyled or styled modes.
- **Vuetify**: Material Design (Google style). Very opinionated.
- **Headless UI / Radix Vue**: Unstyled, accessible primitives (Build your own design system).

## Key Takeaways

- **Tailwind** is great for layout and bespoke design.
- **PrimeVue/Vuetify** are great for Enterprise/Dashboard apps where speed matters more than unique design.
