# 1. Before we get started

## 🎯 Learning Goal

Understand the context of "Schema First".

## 🧠 Concept

In "Code First", we used decorators on classes.
In **Schema First**, we write the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) manually.
Then, NestJS generates the TypeScript interfaces for us.

## 💻 Implementation

Files will live in `src/graphql/*.graphql`.

## 🧩 Activity / Challenge

1.  Mentally prepare to write `.graphql` files.
2.  Install the same dependencies: `@nestjs/graphql`, `@nestjs/apollo`, `graphql`.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Schema First is great if the API is designed by a separate team or shared across languages.
