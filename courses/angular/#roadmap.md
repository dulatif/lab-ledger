Based on the `angular.pdf` roadmap, here is a structured syllabus for mastering Angular, divided into three proficiency levels.

### **Level 1: Beginner (Core Concepts & Components)**

**Goal:** Understand the framework's architecture, master the component model, and build basic interactive UIs.

**Module 1: Foundations & Architecture**

- **Prerequisites:** Mastery of "JavaScript Roadmap" and "Learn TypeScript Basics".

- **Overview:** "Introduction to Angular", its "History", and the "Angular Architecture".

- **Setup:** "Setting up a New Project" using the "Angular CLI".

- **Module System:** Understanding "Module Architecture", "Creating Modules", and "Feature Modules".

**Module 2: Components & Templates**

- **Anatomy:** "Component Anatomy" including "Selector", "Template", "Styles", and "Metadata".

- **Creation:** "Creating Components" and understanding "Standalone" components.

- **Communication:** Managing "Parent-Child Interaction" via `@Input & @Output` and "ViewChild".

- **Lifecycle:** Mastering the "Component Lifecycle" hooks.

**Module 3: Template Syntax & Binding**

- **Data Binding:** "Understand Binding", "Property Binding", "Attribute Binding", and "Event Binding".

- **Directives:** Using "Structural Directives" and "Attribute Directives".

- **Control Flow:** Implementing modern control flow: `@if`, `@else`, `@for`, `@switch`, `@case`, and `@defer`.

- **Pipes:** Using "Common Pipes" for data formatting.

### **Level 2: Intermediate (Data, Forms & Routing)**

**Goal:** Manage state, handle complex forms, route between views, and interact with backend services.

**Module 4: Dependency Injection & Services**

- **DI System:** Mastering "Dependency Injection", "Provider", and "viewProvider".

- **Services:** Creating "Services & Remote Data" to manage logic.

- **HTTP:** Using "HTTP Client", "Setting Up the Client", "Making Requests", and "Writing Interceptors".

**Module 5: Routing & Navigation**

- **Basics:** Setting up "Router Outlets" and "Router Links".

- **Advanced:** "Router Events", "Guards", and "Lazy Loading" (and lazy loading modules).

**Module 6: Forms Management**

- **Template-Driven:** Building "Template-driven Forms".

- **Reactive:** Building complex "Reactive Forms" and "Typed Forms".

- **Validation:** Implementing "Custom Validators" and using "Control Value Accessor".

**Module 7: Reactivity with RxJS**

- **Basics:** "RxJS Basics" and the "Observable Pattern".

- **Streams:** "Observable Lifecycle", "Operators" (Transformation, Filtering), and "RxJS vs Promises".

---

### **Level 3: Advanced (Performance, State & Ops)**

**Goal:** Optimize application performance, implement global state management, and ensure robust security and testing.

**Module 8: Modern State & Signals**

- **Signals:** Implementing "Signals", "Inputs as Signals", and "Queries as Signals".

- **Global State:** "State Management" with "NgRx" or "NGXS".

- **Interoperability:** "RxJS Interop" with signals.

**Module 9: Performance Optimization**

- **Rendering:** "Change Detection" strategies, "Zoneless Applications", and "Hydration".

- **Loading:** "Deferrable Views" and "Image Optimization".

- **Strategies:** Handling "Slow Computations" and "AoT Compilation".

**Module 10: Testing & Security**

- **Testing:** "End-to-End Testing", "Testing Services", "Testing Pipes", and "Code Coverage".

- **Security:** Handling "Cross-site Scripting", "Sanitization", and "HTTP Vulnerabilities" (CSRF, XSRF).

**Module 11: Deployment & Internationalization**

- **Rendering Modes:** "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering) and "SSG" (Static Site Generation).

- **I18n:** "Internationalization" and "Translation Files".

- **CI/CD:** "Deployment", "Build Environments", and "CLI Builders".

**Would you like me to create a practical exercise on converting a "Component" to use the new "Signals" architecture?**
